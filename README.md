# Stirling-Interpolation
1-Program print tables in the form of triangular shape from left to right 

2- As an input program will take  x0 and x and function f(x) to be interpolated and range of x values I.e. x-data.

3- Depends on the method and location of x0 your matlab program should high light by colour or rectangles the entries of table that your are using in the interpolation.

4- Program will compute the interpolated value and error. 

5- Program is general to take x0 at any location within the data table
